### Hello ðŸ‘‹

feel free to reach out :) <br>
email: [luxzi@pm.me](mailto:luxzi@pm.me)

I've been coding since 2016 or around 9 years. I love everything and anything low-level, from operating system development to graphics programming. Although I sometimes dabble in web development. My current hyperfixations are functional programming languages and graphics programming.

**Feel free to mention me in issues or pull requests**, and I may contribute to your project.
